                    The 13-weeks long full-time course covered a wide range of concepts from programming fundamentals through to back-end and front-end.
                    The expansive curriculum gave me an opportunity to learn both functional and object-oriented programming, along with industry-standard practices such as TTD (test-driven development), pair programming, and MVC architecture.
